# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, written in the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language.

The project is compose of two main parts:

- A library, located in the [`lib/`](lib/) directory, containing the code for the solutions.
- A set of tests, located in the [`test/`](test/) directory, containing the tests for the solutions.

Tests are written using the [:octocat: minitest](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) framework.

To run the tests, simply run the following command:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```
